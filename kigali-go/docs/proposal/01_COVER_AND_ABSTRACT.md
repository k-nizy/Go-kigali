## ABSTRACT

Public transportation in Kigali, Rwanda serves over 1.2 million residents daily, yet passengers face significant challenges in navigating the complex transport network. According to the Rwanda Transport Development Agency (2024), approximately 68% of commuters report difficulties in estimating fares accurately, 54% struggle with route planning, and 43% have experienced overcharging incidents. Traditional approaches to addressing these challenges rely on physical route maps, word-of-mouth information from fellow passengers, and manual fare negotiations, which are inefficient and prone to errors. While software solutions exist in developed countries, African cities like Kigali lack context-appropriate digital tools that accommodate local transport modes including Tap&Go buses, shared taxis, and motorcycle taxis (motos).

This project proposes KigaliGo, a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed specifically for Kigali passengers to plan multi-modal trips, estimate fares accurately, track vehicles in real-time, and report safety concerns. The solution addresses critical gaps in existing transport apps by supporting Rwanda's unique transport ecosystem, providing offline functionality for areas with limited connectivity, offering bilingual support (English and Kinyarwanda), and implementing transparent fare calculation aligned with official tariffs. The justification for KigaliGo stems from the need to empower passengers with reliable information, reduce fare disputes, improve transport efficiency, and create a safer commuting environment through community-driven feedback mechanisms. By leveraging modern web technologies and open-source mapping solutions, KigaliGo aims to enhance the daily commuting experience for thousands of Kigali residents.
