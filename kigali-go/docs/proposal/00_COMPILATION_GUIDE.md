- **API endpoints** (simple_app.py, auth.py)
- **Fare calculation logic** (fare_rule.py lines 50-84)
- **Authentication** (auth.py complete file)

### From Your Frontend Code:
- **Pages** (HomePage.js, MapPage.js, FareEstimatorPage.js, ReportsPage.js, ProfilePage.js, PlanTripPage.js)
- **Technologies used** (package.json dependencies)
- **Features implemented** (React Router, Leaflet maps, i18next translations)

### From Your Project Files:
- **README.md** (project overview, tech stack, features)
- **Architecture** (Docker compose, file structure)
- **Deployment info** (Vercel, Render, PostgreSQL)
